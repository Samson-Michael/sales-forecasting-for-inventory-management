# Sales Forecasting For Inventory Management

## Project Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting. We aim to predict store sales using data from **Corporation Favorita**, a major grocery retailer based in Ecuador.

Our goal is to develop a model that can more accurately forecast the unit sales of thousands of items sold across various Favorita stores.

# DATA UNDERSTANDING

The project involves a diverse dataset collection, with the primary dataset, train.csv, providing time series data on store, product family, sales, and promotions. Target sales predictions are the focus, with test.csv mirroring the features for predictions. transaction.csv adds transaction data for sales context. Store metadata is in stores.csv, oil prices in oil.csv, and holidays/events in holidays_events.csv. This comprehensive dataset suite aids in forecasting sales and gaining valuable retail insights.
