# Sales Forecasting For Inventory Management

This project focuses on time series forecasting. We aim to predict store sales using data from **Corporation Favorita**, a major grocery retailer based in Ecuador.

Our goal is to develop a model that can more accurately forecast the unit sales of thousands of items sold across various Favorita stores.
